# Principal-component-analysis

A linear dimensionality reduction technique that can be utilized for extracting information from a high-dimensional space by projecting it into a lower-dimensional sub-space.
It is used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.

This code allows the user to perform PCA on images where the user is asked for an image as a input and the size of the image is reduced while the important part remians intact.
